# Handoff Summary: YEGA Client Application

## 1. Current Status
The user-facing client application for YEGA is complete from a UI/UX and functional prototype perspective. All screens and user flows have been implemented using simulated data.

The application is built with:
- **Vite**
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **shadcn/ui**

## 2. Pending Handoff: Backend Integration
The primary pending task is the development of a backend API to make the application fully functional.

A detailed API specification has been prepared to guide this development. This document outlines all necessary endpoints, data structures, and expected behaviors required to support the frontend application.

**The complete API specification can be found here:**
[./docs/API_HANDOFF.md](./docs/API_HANDOFF.md)

## 3. Next Steps
1.  **Backend Development:** Implement the API as per the specification document.
2.  **Frontend Integration:** Replace the simulated data in the client application with live API calls to the new backend.
3.  **Testing:** Conduct end-to-end testing to ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
